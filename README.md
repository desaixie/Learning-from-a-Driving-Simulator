# Learning-from-a-Driving-Simulator
`/research` is adapted from the Github repo for the paper [*Learning a Driving Simulator*](https://github.com/commaai/research)  
`/future-image-similarity` is adapted from the Github repo for the paper [*Model-based Behavioral Cloning with Future Image Similarity Learning*](https://github.com/anwu21/future-image-similarity)  
`/research-proj` is my own work, built upon the two repos.
